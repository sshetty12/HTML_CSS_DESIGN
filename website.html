    <p class="a2"></p>Yoga is an ancient form of spiritual exercise that is performed to better our bodies and minds. Its origins date back as 500 BCE when it was scripted in the Rig Vedas. It is a sacred text of the Hindus. It’s believed that yoga was practiced as a form of extreme discipline by the ancient Indian priests. They sat in deep meditation for days without food or water. The modern-day yoga consists of some Asana or poses that can be practiced easily. There are some complex asanas too, which need a lot of practice and flexibility. Yoga is something that people of all ages can practice, be it young or old. Some people even describe yoga as an art form. This is said because of the special skills possessed by expert yoga practitioners. It is advised that you practice yoga on the ground by sitting on a mat. </p>
